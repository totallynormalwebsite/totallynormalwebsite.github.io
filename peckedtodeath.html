        The birds are not happy...
    </h1>

    <p> 
        Before you can even take action, <br>
        the birds pounce on you with surprising force <br>
        You are knocked violently to the ground <br>
        as the rest of the avians begin to tear at your flesh <br>
        In a matter of seconds, you are nothing <br>
        but a pile of clean bones. <br>
        As you die, you cannot help but think <br>
        "Am I as tasty as a BBQ chicken wing?"
