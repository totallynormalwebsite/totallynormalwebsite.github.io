         As you stand in your home triumphantly, you feel yourself beginning to transform. <br>
         Consuming the birds has given you their powers. With your magnificent new God powers,<br>
          you take over the world, effectively becoming the avian version of a brutal dictator: bird-Hitler. <br>
          The world falls into a second dark age under the rule of your iron fist- er- talon.
