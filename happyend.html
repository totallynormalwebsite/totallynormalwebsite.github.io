<title> A Compelling Journey Awaits... </title>

<h2>Accepting your fate, you step out into a bright summer day. <br>
You take flight into the wonderful outdoors, you are overcome with a fulfilling brand of joy; <br>
you are confident that the life ahead of your contains great things. <br>
You lead your entourage of avian friends to your neighborâ€™s house and knock on his door. <br>
As your neighbor scoops you up and brings you into their home, presumably to take care of you, you cannot help but feverishly grin.<br>
 And so the cycle continues. </h2>
