    <h1>
        You decide to eat the birds
    </h1>

    <p>
        In one fluid motion, you sweep your wing across the floor and collect all of your babies. <br>
         You shape your wings into a funnel and tilt your head, <br>
          effectively using gravity to your advantage and <br>
          making all of your children slide down into gizzard smoothly.
          </p>
