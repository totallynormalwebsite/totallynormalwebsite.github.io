    <h1>You decide that you are insatiably hungry, and that this group of birds <br>
     must be a blessing from the Gods to satisfy your needs. <br></h1>

</p> Taking the birds inside, you preheat your oven to a toasty 400 degrees <br>
and start prepping the birds for consumption. <br>
Unfortunately, the birds are not very pleased by your choices, <br>
and fight back, knocking you unconscious in one swipe. <br>
The oven, still on, eventually starts a fire that burns your house down and takes you with it
     
<h1> GAME OVER </h1>
